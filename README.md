A Unity mini-game where players sort falling objects into matching colored bins by dragging and dropping. Designed to test motor skills and categorization — useful for cognitive exercises or early dementia screening prototypes.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Randomly colored objects (Cube, Sphere, Capsule) fall from above.
- Player must **drag and drop** them into the correct color-matching bin.

- Game ends when lives reach 0.
- Option to restart the game at any time.

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Launch the scene.
2. Wait for objects to spawn and fall.
3. **Drag** each falling object to the bin that matches its color.
4. If it falls into the correct bin without dragging, it's still valid.
5. Avoid letting them fall on the wrong bin or to the ground.
6. Game ends after 3 incorrect attempts (lives = 0).
7. Press Restart to try again.
